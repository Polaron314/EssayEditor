The morning was brisk and chilling, but I didn’t expect less from a few hours after a February dawn. It didn’t matter anyway, as I would spend the next three and a half hours driving. My friend and I had been planning this day for months, which were full of late nights, tireless research, and pages of code. I brought with me, in the car, a 1 kg weather balloon on which I would launch a small payload; the payload carried a wide array of sensors: a gps, altimeter, ozone sensor, methane sensor, and a thermocouple (which measures temperature). I did enjoy assembling and configuring everything, nerdy as it may be. Once we arrived at the launch site, I began to assemble the final parts of the payload in order to  prepare for the actual launch. We spent at least two hours in the freezing cold configuring the antennae, electronics, and heating system; inflating the balloon with helium tanks; and tying the parachute and the entire body together. Everything was perfectly queued for launch; every problem was fixed, and every system was functional.
