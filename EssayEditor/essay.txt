Late sophomore year, my school sent out an email inviting anyone interested in technology and computer science to apply for an internship at an investment management firm called Loomis Sayles in Boston. Computer Science is something I’ve always something I have been interested in, even as a child. I promptly replied to the initial email and sat down with my school’s Program Director, who scheduled the interview with the company.

Riding on the train into Boston was, truthfully, nerve-racking. Although I felt somewhat confident about the interview, a hovering wisp of doubt still hovered over the seat next to me. Having my first job interview and the actual chance of being employed in a financial company housed in a skyscraper filled me with enough excitement and fear I hadn’t the slightest clue what to think. Before I knew it, however, my train nestled into Boston’s South Station and I journeyed over to Loomis.
