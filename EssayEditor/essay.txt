The mystical land of Pandora is the focus of the movie Avatar, by James Cameron. Pandora, a world not dissimilar from our own, is being mined for a precious mineral essential to solving an ongoing energy crisis on Earth. However, this comes at the expense of exotic flora and fauna, along with the humanoid Na’vi. Jake Sully, a retired paraplegic marine, finds himself working for “the company”, RDA (a massive conglomerate), aiding in interactions with the Na’vi and coercing them to yield land for mining. These interactions come in the form of the Avatar program, which allows humans to control half-human half-Na’vi beings entitled Avatars. This journey takes Sully from a marine to a leader of the local Na’vi tribe, and it leads him to conflict against the humans attempting to strip the planet of resources and, consequently, life. This movie has personally aided in development of my attitudes regarding the environment and stark casteism. Its portrayal of classically Romantic ideas in a modern setting has helped me and likely many others understand Romantic Ideas and relate with them. Avatar, by narrating the tale of a solitary hero, by combating class/race differences, and by presenting a complementary view of nature presents a stark modern-day example of Romanticism.
