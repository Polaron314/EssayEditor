The morning was brisk and chilling, but I didn’t expect less from a few hours after a February dawn. It didn’t matter anyway, as I would spend the next three and a half hours   driving. My friend and I had been planning this day for months, which were full of late nights, tireless research, and pages of code. I brought with me, in the car, a 1 kg weather balloon on which I would launch a small payload; the payload carried a wide array of sensors: a gps, altimeter, ozone sensor, methane sensor, and a thermocouple (which measures temperature). I did enjoy assembling and configuring everything, nerdy as it may be. Once we arrived at the launch site, I began to assemble the final parts of the payload in order to  prepare for the actual launch. We spent at least two hours in the freezing cold configuring the antennae, electronics, and heating system; inflating the balloon with helium tanks; and tying the parachute and the entire body together. Everything was perfectly queued for launch; every problem was fixed, and every system was functional. After a long ceremonial countdown, I released the balloon. It soared high into the air… and then stopped ascending and plummeted to the ground. I had addressed every minutiae— except for one: the helium we were using was only 75% helium due to a helium shortage,  and we thus failed to create adequate lift. At that point, it took at least a quarter-hour to allow what had just transpired to sink in. My mother, who had accompanied us, told me to “focus not on my mistakes but on my successes.” Pondering this, I knew I could not let all of my successes go to waste without a fight. The launch site was in the middle of nowhere in a small town on the NY-CT border with a population density comparable to that of northern Maine. However, all I needed to find was a balloon shop. Balloon shops sell helium in excess. Luckily, there was one a mere thirty minutes away. However, the inflated balloon couldn’t nearly fit in a car, so we had to leave it. In a public park. On the side of the road. In the middle of nowhere. For an hour. It was a necessary risk, our only choice, even if I was barely comfortable with it. I must admit, the owner of the balloon store must have had some suspicions watching me walk out of a balloon store with 3 jumbo helium tanks that could individually fill 27 balloons. The ride back was by far the most stressful part of the day. If that balloon was missing, my entire gamble would be forfeit. Countless hours and all of the equipment I had on it would be lost, possibly forever. With a bit of luck, and a lot of hope, I saw the white sphere in the distance ahead on the side of the road. I inflated the balloon with the party shop tanks and cut down on some non-essential systems to ensure the balloon lifted off. And it did. Up into the sky, past the clouds, and out of sight. Using the antenna system I had previously devised, I maintained contact with the balloon and logged its location. The balloon rose up to approximately 20,000 ft, well beyond the initial boundary of the ozone layer. The project, despite the complications we had encountered, ended up being a success. We didn’t meet some of our secondary goals, but the core of the project progressed us through the school, regional, and state science fairs. In the end, especially with new projects, adversity and error will always occur. It is foolish to think that you can plan for everything; you will never make a mistake; you will be absolutely perfect. What defines a successful person is how he or she handles failure.
